My project was to create a News page using The New York Times API to get the Top Stories live on a page using Jquery, HTML, CSS, Sass and Gulp.

I added the elements on the page with JS instead of HTML, and implemented a mobile-first, responsive layout (optimized for the three required screen sizes). This News page is responsive for mobiles, tablets and desktops.

Project Instanews is a learning project which uses the New York Times API to retrieve a list of top stories for a given section and then populates a news grid of up to 12 items.

### Project Demonstrations

Project Instanews demonstrates the following:
- CSS reset
- background property
- use of box model
- use of css properties used for altering visual display of text
    - ie. font-family, font-style, text-transform, etc...
- uses custom fonts (@font-face)
- Icon fonts
- CSS3 properties such as box-shadow and border-radius
- Use Sass as a preprocessor, with CSS properly compiled and minified
- Uses flexbox layouts rather than floats
- Responsive and optimized for three screen sizes: mobile, tablet, and desktop
- JS Usage:
    - Use Ajax to fetch data from the NYT Top Stories endpoint
    - Only display a maximum of 12 stories in the grid, and only display a story if it has a photo associated with it
    - Transition users between UI states, starting where no stories have been returned, and then subsequently transitioning where stories populate the grid (by incorporating a loading gif)

Functional requirements:
- Dynamically fetch story data and populate it in a webpage via the Top Stories API based a userâ€™s selection from a select field
- Resize the header area (i.e. logo plus select) so that it transitions from occupying the entire screen on page load to only auto height after the select field is changed (you will need jQuery for this)
- Link each returned image to its URL on the NYT website
