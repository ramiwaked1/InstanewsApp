# Project 2: Instanews App

My project was to create a News page using The New York Times API to get the Top Stories live on a page using Jquery, HTML, CSS, Sass and Gulp.

I added the elements on the page with JS instead of HTML, and implemented a mobile-first, responsive layout (optimized for the three required screen sizes). This News page is responsive for mobiles, tablets and desktops.
